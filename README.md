# Anki MCT (Massive-Context Cloze-Highlighted Text)
Based on the AJATT MCD (Massive-Context Clozed Deletion) concept. An MCT is essentially the same as an MCD, but the clozes are not a classical clozed deletion.

Rather, the generated cards shows/highlights the content (normally a word) being tested.
It would be the equivalent to setting the hint text of a cloze to the content that would otherwise be hidden.
This is much better for those with minimal vocabulary. I prefer it because it feels less like a test.
Adds to the fun-factor.
 
## Personal Setup

### My general process is as such.

1. Watch anime, read manga, and other general immersion activities.
1. When a sentence or passage grabs me, capture that context in a video, image, sound, and/or description.
1. Add as much of that content (text and context) as I feel confident with to the front side of a card. This might only be one word in the worst case.
1. Cloze the words I feel most confident in grading myself on.
1. Add as much of a translation, including readings for relevant words, as I feel confident with to the answer side.

### My Sentence deck is set up as such.

1. My custom card is based on Cloze so that it can support multiple clozes.
1. Fields are `Sentence`, `Context`, `Meaning`, `Extra`. Technically, the first two could be combined and the last two could be combined; this merely reflects personal preference.
1. `Sentence` and `Meaning` are question/answer counterparts.
1. `Context` typically contains a video, image, and/or description of the context to remind me what the sentence is from.
1. `Extra` typically contains readings and basic definitions.

## Goals

This addon only serves to provide some slight automation for this process.

This addon is intended to assist in generating card content in a platform independent way.
